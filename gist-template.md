# Regex Breakdown

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)

 Symbols and letters are called characters and we use Regular Expressions for writing patterns to match and/or identify a specific sequence of characters or (in our case string). Regular Expressions are useful in taking out information from code. We use Regular Expressions to validate input or find/replace characters within a string.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

This tutorial will explain the use of Regex to match/verify emails. We will use the expression `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. The email we will use in this is douglassnoddyjr@gmail.com

## Regex Components

### Anchors 
Anchors are used to check if the mactching symbol  is the starter symbol or ending symbol of the input string. There are two types of anchors: the caret `^` and the `$`. `^` means the beginning of the string and `$` means the end of a string.
